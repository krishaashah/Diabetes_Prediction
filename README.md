# Diabetes Prediction

## Project Overview: ##
In this project I implemented python and machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on their health metrics and medical history. Using a dataset that includes features like age, BMI, blood sugar levels, heart rate, and more, the goal was to classify individuals as either diabetic or non-diabetic.

## Key Features: ##

**Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
  
**Model Selection:** Implemented multiple classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest.
**Model Evaluation:** Evaluated the model using performance metrics F1 score.
  
**Final Model:** Achieved an accuracy score of **81%**, demonstrating a reliable model for diabetes prediction.

**Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

This project aims to provide a predictive model that can assist in detection and management of diabetes. The dataset and code can be further enhanced with additional features, algorithms, and optimization techniques.
