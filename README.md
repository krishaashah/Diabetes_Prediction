# Diabetes Prediction

## Project Overview: ##
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on their health metrics and medical history. Using a dataset that includes features like age, BMI, blood sugar levels, heart rate, and more, the goal is to classify individuals as either diabetic or non-diabetic.

## Key Features: ##

**Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
  
**Model Selection:** Implemented multiple classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). After evaluating model performance, **SVM proved to be the most effective**, delivering the best results in terms of accuracy and predictive power.
  
**Model Evaluation:** Evaluated the model using metrics like accuracy, AUC, and confusion matrix.
  
**Final Model:** Achieved an accuracy score of **78%**, demonstrating a reliable model for diabetes prediction.

**Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
